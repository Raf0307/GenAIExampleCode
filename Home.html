                    ChatGPT is a conversational language model
                    developed by OpenAI based on the GPT-3.5 architecture.
                    GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer,"
                    and it represents a class of models that leverage transformer
                    architecture for natural language processing tasks.

                    GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool
                    developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It is
                    designed to assist developers in writing code more
                    efficiently by providing intelligent code suggestions
                    directly within their integrated development environment (IDE)

                    Bard is designed as an interface to an LLM that enables
                    users to collaborate with generative AI. We believe
                    one of the promises of LLM-based innovations like Bard
                    is to help people unlock their human potential so
                    they can augment their imagination, expand their curiosity,
                    and enhance their productivity
